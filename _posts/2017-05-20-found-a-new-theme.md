Today I found a new color scheme while playing around the settings on my sublime text.
The theme is called [Ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu).
It looks so slick and soothing so just want to share it.

Now I am debating whether I should switch my vim color scheme from [Tomorrow-Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) to [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim).
