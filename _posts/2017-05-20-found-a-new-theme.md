title: Found a New Color Scheme

Today, I discovered a new color scheme while experimenting with settings in Sublime Text. The theme, called [Ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu), looks sleek and soothing, and I wanted to share it.

Now I'm debating whether to switch my Vim color scheme from [Tomorrow-Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) to [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim).
