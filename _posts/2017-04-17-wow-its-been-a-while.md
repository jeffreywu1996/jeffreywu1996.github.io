  Wow! A turn of an eye, and it has been almost 2 months since I touched this blog.
</div>

It took me around 3 months to finally sit down at my desk and focus some time on this blog.

There was a bug with the theme I use for website and finding the solution was failing road. The bug was the post URLs are broken and cannot be referenced.

Today (May 10, 2017) I finally found the solution to the bug. Guess where I found the issue? The theme's github issue page. LOL, I should have visited that page much earlier. For those interetested [here's](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/issues/108#issuecomment-104944040) the link to the bug.

This issue turned out to be a extra character in one of the source files which lead to the post URLs display incorrectly.

Now, after fixing this bug, I have found more confidence in continuing this site. So, yay.

As always,
Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed it!
