  Wow! It has been nearly two months since I last updated this blog.
</div>

It took me about three months to finally sit down and focus on updating the blog.

I encountered a bug with the theme where post URLs were broken and could not be referenced. Today (May 10, 2017), I discovered the solutionâ€”thanks to a tip on the theme's GitHub issues page. For those interested, here's the [link to the discussion](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/issues/108#issuecomment-104944040).

After fixing the bug, I feel more confident about continuing to maintain this site.

Thanks for reading!
