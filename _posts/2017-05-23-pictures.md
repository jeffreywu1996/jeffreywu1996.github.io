Writing blog post is fun, but pure text can be boring sometimes. And sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Therefore, today I am going to find out how to post images on my blog.


**Update:** I found a new sneaky way of uploading images.
The method below kind of breaks the https encrytion (the green lock at the top of the url address on your browser, and I don't like it)
I am not exactly sure of why this happens. But the browser complained that the site is not secure anymore because
> Attackers might be able to see the images youâ€™re looking at on this site and trick you by modifying them.
I am not entirely sure what that means, but it does not seem very good.

To overcome that break of security of my site, I have found another way to upload picutres via github.
The trick is to create a issue on the any github repo, drag the image into the issues section and wait for it to upload. After it is done uploading, it will have a link of the picture. And viola, the picture is uploaded to github and you have a link to that picture.

**Note.** I also changed the picture example below to use the method I learned above to keep my website 'secure'.

I found a guide [here](http://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/30/adding_images_and_downloads_to_a_github_pages_jekyll_blog.html) which includes instructions on how to host pictures on the blog.

There is two steps to putting up images on the site.
1. First, I need to know how to put up the image on the blog. This can be accomplished easily with using Markdown (which we use to write our blog).
2. Second, I need a location to put the image at. In other words, I need to host the image somewhere on the internet.

## Show images using Markdown
[Here's](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) a cheatsheet I found online that tells you how to put images up with markdown.

## Host images on github
There are many ways to upload images on the internet. A simple google search will show image hosting sites avaliable for free. But why rely on those when we can do it ourselves. I have a minimalist mindset. If I can find a way to do it myself, then that will be the priority.

Since this blog is hosted on github itself, I can create a folder within that repository hosted by github and thus have a directory on the internet where I can host things.
First create a directory that will store the images that I will host.
I will call this directory `/assets`
Go to the directory of the blog, and type `mkdir assets`.

Now, stuff in the `/assets` can be accessed on the internet with the link.
For example if I have an image called huis-ten-bosch.png, then I can access it with the link `{{ site.url }}/assets/huis-ten-bosch.png`

Now, using this link with markdown, we should be able to finally put the image on the internet.

Let's try it. This is a picture of me last summer at Huis Ten Bosch. Let's see if it shows up.

Vola! Success.
