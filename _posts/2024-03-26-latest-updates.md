Hi, it has been a while since I updated this blog.

To find my most recent updates, please follow my github profile at (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996) for some of the latest projects I am working on.

I will try to write up some blogs on deep diving into some of the projects when I find some time.

Some projects I am currently working on:

1. Microservice based barista service written with fastapi and postgres (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/barista-order-service)

2. Eufy streaming security camera ML project (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/eufy-video-streaming)

3. Virtual world with cars (https://github.com/jeffreywu1996/simulated-network-scenarios) - Need to move to new repo.
