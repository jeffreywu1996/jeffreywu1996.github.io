I cannot stand a slow computer. It just drives me nuts.

Whenever I feel my macbook gets slow, I just wipe it clean and reset everything to its factory state.
This removes all the unecessary clutters and makes my macbook "brand new" again.

However, there is a problem. Though resetting the computer is easy, installing back all the software I use is a tedious job.
Therefore, as a programmer, I wanted to automate this proccess.

Some of the most important programs I cannot live without are:

* Google Chrome -> It's great that everything gets sync'ed in when I login to the browser.
* VLC -> I love watching movies.
* Spotify -> I need my songs.

Besides these programs, I also want my terminal and vim settings to stay the way they were.

This includes:

* Terminal settings
* Vim settings
* Tmux settings


Today I want to talk about Brewfile.
