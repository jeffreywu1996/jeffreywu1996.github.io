## Why tmux
I love the terminal. Using it makes me feel like a badass hacker.
Sometimes I want to be able to do multiple task on one terminal, like use vim on one side, and compiling my code on the other.

There is a tool called tmux which allows me to accomplish this task.

One downside to this tool is its slightly steep learning curve. Using it requires some weird key strokes, which is part of the reason why I never really got the chance to dive into it until now.

## Starting tmux
To start up tmux, simply type in the terminal,
`tmux`

If your terminal looks like this, (yellow bar on the bottom) then you are good to go.
