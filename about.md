<p class="message">
  Hey there! Welcome to my blog, where I share insights on programming, homelab projects, photography, and more.
</p>

I created this blog as a platform to learn more about Jekyll and to express my passion for technology and creativityâ€”all built on the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme.

## Who Am I?

I'm a Computer Science student at UCSD with a deep passion for coding. While I often get busy with a variety of interests, this blog helps me reconnect with my love for technology and share my journey with you.

*More about me coming soon!*
