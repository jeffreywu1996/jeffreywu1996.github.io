  Hey there! This is a blog where I post about random things from my life that I want to share with everyone.
</p>

Main reason I created this blog is to learn how Jeykll works, I took the theme Lanyon as a template and write random post here.

## Who am I

I am a student studying Computer Science at UCSD. I love to code, though, I keep getting myself so busy with random activities that I found myself stopped coding for fun.

I want to get back this passion of coding for fun. And hopefully thru blogging, I will want to learn new things about this field and share with you guys on this blog.

TODO: more about myself.
